## Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The main challenge is working with the api because I found it really difficult to identify the way I need to pass the headers to api such that
it returns the list of filtered results for me to Consume in react project. Consuming the data in to react project and presenting to the end user
as per the given specifications is also challenging.
